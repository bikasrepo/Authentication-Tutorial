## 1. Introduction to Ping Identity and OAuth

**Ping Identity** is a leading enterprise identity and access management (IAM) provider offering solutions for Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and modern authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

**OAuth 2.0** is a standard protocol designed for delegated access and authorization, enabling secure, standards-based authentication flows widely used in modern identity platforms including Ping Identity.

## 2. Free Tutorials and Trial Information for Ping Identity

- Ping Identity offers official video tutorials through its video portal, covering integration of authentication solutions, configuring SSO, MFA, and PingOne tenant usage.  
- A **free 30-day PingOne trial** is available, allowing users to experiment with Ping's cloud identity platform without payment.  
- **DevOps program trial credentials** are provided for developers needing to test Ping Identity products in Docker or local developer environments.

## 3. Ping Identity DevOps Trial Credentials

To get DevOps trial credentials:

- Register on the Ping Identity DevOps portal with your business email.
- Receive your DevOps **User** and **Key**, which are used as environment variables or configured via the Ping CLI (`pingctl`).
- These credentials provide a trial license to deploy and test Ping Identity components locally in containers or CI/CD pipelines.

## 4. Migrating Corporate Applications to Ping Identity

### Step-by-Step Migration Guide

1. **Assessment**  
   Inventory applications and current SSO protocols (SAML, OAuth, OIDC).  

2. **PingOne Tenant Setup**  
   Register and create admin accounts.  

3. **User Directory Migration**  
   Migrate identities using PingIDM or LDAP connectors with matching schema.  

4. **Configure Ping Identity SSO for Each App**  
   - Create application connections in Ping admin console with appropriate protocol.  
   - Input Entity IDs, ACS URLs, and certificates.  
   - Map user attributes and groups.  

5. **Modify In-house SSO Configuration**  
   Replace IdP metadata and endpoints with those from Ping Identity.  

6. **Testing and Rollout**  
   Test authentication flows and roll out incrementally or as a big switch.  

7. **Enable Federated SSO** for clients by configuring IdP connections, exchanging metadata, and verifying assertion mappings.

## 5. Integrating Ping Authentication with Angular Applications

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Register Angular App in PingOne**  
   - Create OIDC client with redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:4200/callback`).  

2. **Setup Angular Project**  
   - Add the Ping SDK or `oidc-client-ts` library.  

3. **Configure SDK with Ping Client Info**  

4. **Implement Login, Callback, and Logout Logic**  

5. **Protect Routes and Authenticated API Calls**  

6. **Test Full Authentication Cycle**

*Include client ID, authority URL, redirect URIs as obtained from the PingOne app registration.*

## 6. Hands-on Tutorials for PingOne Da Vinci Flow

PingOne Da Vinci is a **no-code identity orchestration engine** enabling drag-and-drop design of authentication and access flows.

- Use Ping video portal and official SDK tutorials for practical flow building including login, registration, password reset, risk-based auth.  
- Learn integration techniques and partner onboarding to extend flows.

## 7. Understanding PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) with Mind Map and Mnemonics

### What is PKCE?

Security extension to OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow to protect against interception attacks, especially for single-page and mobile apps.
